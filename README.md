Issues with the default 256 squares
  -The default squares have this automatic margin or padding at main start of the first line, offsetting the grid. However, once a number is manually input with the button, the margin is not longer there. 
  -Unwanted space at main end.

Issues with the default 256 squares ==RESOLVED==
  -Still not sure what was happening with the slight space in the first line, however since I decided to remove sketchContainer's gap for a white canvas effect rather than a grid one, the space seems to have resolved itself.
